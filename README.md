Advent of Code 2022 Solutions in Javascript using Node.js

## :santa: Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js & npm installed locally. Personally, I recommend nvm Node version manager, available [here](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).

## :snowman: Getting Started

Clone repository and go to `dayXX` folder.

Provide your input to `data.txt` file (you have to create such file).

You may also run the script with test data provided in `dataTest.txt`. In order to do that, rename it to `data.txt` or change line 6 of the script to `.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'dataTest.txt'), 'utf8')`.

Then, open the terminal in current directory context and run the script

```
node script
```
